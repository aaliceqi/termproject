    <p>
    America wastes roughly 40 percent of its food. Of the estimated 125 to 160 billion pounds of food that goes to waste every year, much of it is perfectly edible and nutritious. While a good chunk of it is caused by bad weather and processing problems, a lot of it is merely food waster from leftover ingredients from your fridge!
    
    Reach targets to do so, by targeting those leftover ingredients one at a time. You might have experienced purchasing a bulk order from Costco or leftovers from a specific recipe. What are you going to do with the leftovers? Unsure about what to do with them now? Reach can help you!
