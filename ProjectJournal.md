What I have done when I was stuck:
<li>youtube tutorials -- on how to use the spoonacular api </li>
<li>asking questions on google -- to clarify concepts (bytes > string > list > dictionary) </li>

4/19 I was able to retrieve the url & ids of the recipes that has some of my ingredients
next: make the flask to see how users would input data.
